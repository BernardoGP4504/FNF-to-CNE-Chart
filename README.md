# Friday Night Funkin' to Codename Engine Chart Converter
A Python script that's able to convert the current Friday Night Funkin' charts into Codename Engine charts.

# How to Use
Before anything, make sure to [install Python (if not already installed)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) so you can run the script.

1. Select your FNF chart (`-chart.json` file)
2. Select the Metadata file accordingly (`-metadata` file, according to song)
3. Type in the difficulty you want to convert. If a unexistent in the chart difficulty is typed, it'll prompt you again
4. Specify whether the FNF song has split vocals using `true` or `false`
5. Type in the indentation you want on the converted chart json. If you don't know what that means, just type in `4`
6. Save the converted chart and now it's done :)

# Final Note
It'll also convert camera follow changes (the panning between characters on each section of the song)
